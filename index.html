            <h4>Everest Camp Trek</h4>
            <p>
                Trekking to the <strong>Mount Everest</strong>  Base Camp in Nepal is in many ways like visiting a mountain museum. 
                The only difference is that the things on display are all real. Nowhere else on earth is there such a dense concentration of mountains of such
                stature. Four out of ten of the world’s highest peaks are here. Basically, you will be breathing and eating mountains
                throughout. In the backdrop of this grandeur, you will find the Himalayan Tahrs as tame as your domestic goats, and the
                iridescent Himalayan Monal more trusting than your barn chicken. And to top it all off, the amazing Sherpa hospitality
                comes second to none. In the contemplative adventure that is the Everest Base Camp Trek, you will miss nothing, not even
                the internet.<br />
                
                At the same time, it is also one of the toughest treks in Nepal primarily because of the altitude. You will be spending
                a minimum of 6 nights above 4,000 meters and at least 2 above 5,000 meters. To put this number in perspective, the air
                pressure at 5,000 meters is just above half that of sea level, which means you are seriously short of air up there. But
                as long you remember that you are on vacation and that there is no rush (after all that is the point of a vacation,
                right?), you will do great. Many a people who forget this simple fact of life and underestimate Acute Mountain Sickness
                either end their trek half dazed in a rescue helicopter or in missing posters that you will see along the trail. Go
                slow, even glacial if need be, and this will be the most amazing trip you’ll ever have.
                
                May Happy Feet go with you!!
